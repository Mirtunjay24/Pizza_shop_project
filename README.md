1. Power BI 
        
   Slicers/Filters: The left panel contains dropdown menus for filtering data by order date, pizza category, month name, and day name, which is a common feature in Power BI.
    Card Visuals: The summary metrics (total price, total orders, average order value, total pizzas sold) are displayed using card visuals, a common Power BI feature.
    Bar Charts & Pie Charts: The visualizations include bar charts, pie charts, and stacked bars, which are standard in Power BI and Tableau.
     Background Image: The pizza background is likely applied through Power BI's page formatting options.
3. Data Sources & Processing Tools
      Excel, SQL, or CSV Data Sources: Power BI usually connects to Excel, SQL databases, or CSV files to fetch raw data.
      DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): The calculated metrics like average pizzas per order and percentage sales by category suggest the use of DAX functions.
     Power Query (ETL): Data transformations (like aggregations, filtering, and joins) are probably done using Power Query Editor in Power BI.                                                                         4. Custom Visuals & Formatting
           Custom Images & Icons: The pizza icons and background images suggest custom formatting in Power BI.
            Conditional Formatting: The use of percentages in bar charts (e.g., pizza sales by hour/day) likely uses conditional formatting options.
              Tooltips & Interactions: Clicking filters probably updates other visuals dynamically, a Power BI interaction feature
